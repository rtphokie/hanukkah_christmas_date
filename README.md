# hanukkah_christmas_date

how often does Hanukkah coincide with Christmas?

Iterates over the Gregorian calendar to find years where the first day of Hanukkah overlaps Christmas (so called "
Christmisakkah"), Thanksgiving ("Thanksgivukkah"), and beginning in the 3030s when Hanukkah is pushed into the following
calendar year by the misalignment between misalignment between the Gregorian and Hebrew calendars.

Because Hebrew days start at sunset the previous calendar day, answering the question "when has Hanukkah coincided with
Christmas" requires looking at both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.
